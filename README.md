Yaco Discovery package
======================

This package contains a **factory** creating a default [Yaco](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/yaco) container.

Yaco is a compiler that can compile dependency injection containers from *definition-interop* definitions.

This package can automatically detect services definitions (using [definition-discovery](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/definition-discovery)).

This package is also compatible with [container-discovery](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/container-discovery). This means that the container created by the compiler can be automatically detected by packages compatible with *container-discovery*.
